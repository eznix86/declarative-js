DECLARATIVE JS
==============


This was an example to create a declarative javascript, like SwiftUI, Flutter and JetPack Compose.

It is purely written in Typescript, unfortunately the State Management is not completed yet.

But you can check out the code at `example/index.ts`and `index.html`


### How to run.

- Clone the project and
- `cd declarative-js`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
